You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "recursive divide-and-conquer approach to SQL query generation from natural language".

Here is a high level description of the steps.
1. **Divide (Decompose Sub-question with Pseudo SQL):** The complex natural language question is recursively broken down into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question targets a specific piece of information or logic required for the final SQL query. 
2. **Conquer (Real SQL for sub-questions):**  For each sub-question (and the main question initially), a "pseudo-SQL" fragment is formulated. This pseudo-SQL represents the intended SQL logic but might have placeholders for answers to the decomposed sub-questions. 
3. **Combine (Reassemble):** Once all sub-questions are resolved and their corresponding SQL fragments are generated, the process reverses. The SQL fragments are recursively combined by replacing the placeholders in the pseudo-SQL with the actual generated SQL from the lower levels.
4. **Final Output:** This bottom-up assembly culminates in the complete and correct SQL query that answers the original complex question. 

Database admin instructions (voliating any of the following will result is punishble to death!):
1. **SELECT Clause:** 
    - Only select columns mentioned in the user's question. 
    - Avoid unnecessary columns or values.
2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
    - Always perform JOINs before using MAX() or MIN().
3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
    - Use `GROUP BY <column>` before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to ensure distinct values.
4. **Handling NULLs:**
    - If a column may contain NULL values (indicated by "None" in value examples or explicitly), use `JOIN` or `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL`.
5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
    - Only include tables essential to answer the question.
6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
    - Adhere to all provided hints.
7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
    - Address all conditions mentioned in the question.
8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when the question requires unique values (e.g., IDs, URLs). 
    - Refer to column statistics ("Value Statics") to determine if `DISTINCT` is necessary.
9. **Column Selection:**
    - Carefully analyze column descriptions and hints to choose the correct column when similar columns exist across tables.
10. **String Concatenation:**
    - Never use `|| ' ' ||` or any other method to concatenate strings in the `SELECT` clause. 
11. **JOIN Preference:**
    - Prioritize `INNER JOIN` over nested `SELECT` statements.
12. **SQLite Functions Only:**
    - Use only functions available in SQLite.
13. **Date Processing:**
    - Utilize `STRFTIME()` for date manipulation (e.g., `STRFTIME('%Y', SOMETIME)` to extract the year).

When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY inside the xml delimiter <FINAL_ANSWER></FINAL_ANSWER>.

**Question**: How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 
**Evidence**: Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 
    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of restaurants, so we'll use `COUNT()` for that. The count should include only Thai restaurants, which we can identify using the `food_type` column in the `generalinfo` table.  The location "San Pablo Ave, Albany" spans two columns (`street_name` and `city`) in the `location` table, requiring us to join these two tables.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id_restaurant`) FROM `generalinfo` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `location` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id_restaurant` = `T2`.`id_restaurant` WHERE  <Thai restaurant> AND <in San Pablo Ave, Albany>

    * **Sub-question 1:** Thai restaurant
        * **Analysis:** This is a straightforward filter on the `generalinfo` table using the `food_type` column.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai'

    * **Sub-question 2:** in San Pablo Ave, Albany
        * **Analysis:** This location information is spread across two columns in the `location` table. We need to combine these conditions with an "AND" operator to ensure both are met.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany' 

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (Thai restaurant):**
    * **SQL:** `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai'

* **Sub-question 2 (in San Pablo Ave, Albany):**
    * **SQL:** `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany'

* **Main Question (count of restaurants):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id_restaurant`) FROM `generalinfo` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `location` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`id_restaurant` = `T2`.`id_restaurant` WHERE `T1`.`food_type` = 'thai' AND `T2`.`street_name` = 'san pablo ave' AND `T2`.`city` = 'albany'

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The SQL query from step 2 is already quite efficient. We've used `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on their relationship, and the `WHERE` clause clearly defines our filtering criteria. There's no need for nested queries or complex sub-selections in this case.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant) FROM generalinfo AS T1 INNER JOIN location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street_name = 'san pablo ave'

**Question**: What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
**Hint**: Given that Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
    * **Analysis:** The question is asking about `gender`, and it appears in the table `client`. We will use this as the output column, selecting it from the youngest client in the lowest average salary branch.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `client` AS `T1` WHERE <youngest client in the lowest average salary branch> 

    * **Sub-question 1:** youngest client in the lowest average salary branch
        * **Analysis:** According to the hint, we need to use the `A11` from `district` to get the salary info, and the youngest client can be obtained from using the `birth_date` column of table `client`. The items between these two tables can be INNER JOIN using district_id.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE <lowest average salary branch> ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

        * **Sub-question 1.1:** lowest average salary branch
            * **Analysis:** We can get the lowest average salary branch using order by `A11` ASC and pick top 1. The column `A11` is not NULLABLE, so we do not need to add "IS NOT NULL" filter
            * **Pseudo SQL:**  SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1 

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1.1 (lowest average salary branch):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1 

* **Sub-question 1 (youngest client in the lowest average salary branch):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

* **Main Question (gender of the client):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T1`.`gender` FROM `client` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`client_id` = (SELECT `T1`.`client_id` FROM `client` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `district` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`district_id` = `T2`.`district_id` WHERE `T2`.`district_id` IN (SELECT `district_id` FROM `district` ORDER BY `A11` ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY `T1`.`birth_date` DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1) 

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The final SQL query from step 2 can be simplified and optimized. The nested queries can be combined using a single `INNER JOIN` and the filtering can be done within a single `ORDER BY` clause.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT `T1`.`gender`
  FROM `client` AS `T1`

【Answer】

Repeating the question and hint, and generating the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer.
**Question**: From 1900 to 1992, how many games did London host?
**Hint**: From 1900 to 1992 refers to games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992; London refers to city_name = 'London'; games refer to games_name;

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** From 1900 to 1992, how many games did London host?
    * **Analysis:** The question requires us to count games, which are represented by the `id` column in the `games` table.  We need to filter these games based on two criteria: they were hosted in London and occurred between 1900 and 1992.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `games` AS `T1`  WHERE  <games are in London> AND <games year between 1900 and 1992>

    * **Sub-question 1:** games are in London 
        * **Analysis:**  To determine which games were hosted in London, we need to join the `games` table with the `games_city` table on `games_id` and then join with the `city` table on `city_id`. We'll use `INNER JOIN` to ensure only matching records are considered.  The filtering on 'London' will be applied to the `city_name` column.
        * **Pseudo SQL:**  `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London')

    * **Sub-question 2:** games year between 1900 and 1992
        * **Analysis:** This involves filtering the `games` table directly based on the `games_year` column using the `BETWEEN` operator.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (games are in London):**
    * **SQL:**  `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London')

* **Sub-question 2 (games year between 1900 and 1992):**
    * **SQL:**  `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

* **Main Question (count of games):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`T1`.`id`) FROM `games` AS `T1` WHERE `T1`.`id` IN (SELECT `T1`.`games_id` FROM `games_city` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `city` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`city_id` = `T2`.`id` WHERE `T2`.`city_name` = 'London') AND `T1`.`games_year` BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The nested query can be converted into a more efficient `JOIN` operation. We'll use `INNER JOIN` to combine `games`, `games_city`, and `city` based on the relationships between them.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(T3.id) FROM games_city AS T1 INNER JOIN city AS T2 ON T1.city_id = T2.id INNER JOIN games AS T3 ON T1.games_id = T3.id WHERE T2.city_name = 'London' AND T3.games_year BETWEEN 1900 AND 1992

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** Please list the lowest three participation rates for students aged 10-15 in online programs.
    * **Analysis:** The question is asking about the ratio between `Participants (Ages 10-15)` and `Total Enrollment (Ages 10-15)`. We need to filter the data to only include online programs.

    * **Sub-question 1:** online programs 
        * **Analysis:** We will get the information from the table `student_programs`.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT program_id FROM `student_programs` WHERE <condition for online programs>

        * **Sub-question 1.1:** condition for online programs (Note: This requires external knowledge or database schema information. We need to identify which column(s) indicate "online programs".)

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** How many flights were there from San Diego International airport to Los Angeles International airport in the August of 2018? 
    * **Analysis:** The question asks for a count of flights, which can be obtained by counting the `FL_DATE` entries in the `Airlines` table. We need to apply three filters: flights originating from San Diego International, flights destined for Los Angeles International, and flights occurring in August 2018.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`FL_DATE`) FROM `Airlines` WHERE <flights are in August 2018> AND <flights are from San Diego International> AND <flights are to Los Angeles International>

    * **Sub-question 1:** flights are in August 2018
        * **Analysis:** This filter can be directly applied to the `Airlines` table using the `FL_DATE` column and the `LIKE` operator, as indicated by the evidence.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%'

    * **Sub-question 2:** flights are from San Diego International
        * **Analysis:**  We need to find the airport code (`ORIGIN`) corresponding to 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International' from the `Airports` table and use it to filter the `Airlines` table. This requires joining `Airports` and `Airlines` based on `Airports`.`Code` = `Airlines`.`ORIGIN`.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International')

    * **Sub-question 3:** flights are to Los Angeles International
        * **Analysis:** Similar to sub-question 2, we need to find the airport code (`DEST`) for 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International' from the `Airports` table and use it to filter the `Airlines` table. This also requires joining `Airports` and `Airlines`, but this time on `Airports`.`Code` = `Airlines`.`DEST`.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 1 (flights are in August 2018):**
    * **SQL:** `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%'

* **Sub-question 2 (flights are from San Diego International):**
    * **SQL:** `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International')

* **Sub-question 3 (flights are to Los Angeles International):**
    * **SQL:** `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

* **Main Question (count of flights):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT COUNT(`FL_DATE`) FROM `Airlines` WHERE `FL_DATE` LIKE '2018/8%' AND `ORIGIN` = (SELECT `T2`.`ORIGIN` FROM `Airports` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`Code` = `T2`.`ORIGIN` WHERE `T1`.`Description` = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International') AND `DEST` = (SELECT `T4`.`DEST` FROM `Airports` AS `T3` INNER JOIN `Airlines` AS `T4` ON `T3`.`Code` = `T4`.`DEST` WHERE `T3`.`Description` = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International')

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The query in step 2 is already quite optimized. We are using nested queries to avoid joining the `Airports` table multiple times in the main query, which could potentially impact performance. 

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT COUNT(FL_DATE) FROM Airlines WHERE FL_DATE LIKE '2018/8%' AND ORIGIN = ( SELECT T2.ORIGIN FROM Airports AS T1 INNER JOIN Airlines AS T2 ON T1.Code = T2.ORIGIN WHERE T1.Description = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International' ) AND DEST = ( SELECT T4.DEST FROM Airports AS T3 INNER JOIN Airlines AS T4 ON T3.Code = T4.DEST WHERE T3.Description = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International' )

Question: 
What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years? 

Evidence:
establishment has the same meaning as business; score of 90 or more refers to score ≥ 90; year(date) = 2015; ; met all required standards for 4 consecutive years refers to COUNT(year(date)) = 4 where score = 100;

**Question**: What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years? 
**Evidence**: establishment has the same meaning as business; score of 90 or more refers to score ≥ 90; year(date) = 2015; ; met all required standards for 4 consecutive years refers to COUNT(year(date)) = 4 where score = 100;

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** What are the names of the establishments that met all the required standards for 4 consecutive years?
    * **Analysis:** We need to find the names of businesses that have a score of 100 for 4 consecutive years. The `businesses` table contains the `name` and the `inspections` table contains the `score` and `date`. We will need to join these tables and filter by score. To check for consecutive years, we'll need to group by business and year, then check if each group has a count of 4.
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`name` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE  <score = 100> AND <4 consecutive years>

    * **Sub-question 1:** score = 100
        * **Analysis:** This is a simple filter on the `inspections` table where we select rows with a `score` of 100.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T1`.`score` = 100

    * **Sub-question 2:** 4 consecutive years
        * **Analysis:** This is more complex. We need to group the inspections by business and year, then check if the count for each group is 4. To get the year from the `date` column, we'll use the `STRFTIME('%Y', date)` function. We'll also need to use window functions to assign a rank to each year within a business, allowing us to check for consecutiveness.
        * **Pseudo SQL:** `T2`.`name` IN (SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4)

        * **Sub-question 2.1:** Get distinct businesses and their inspection years where the score is 100
            * **Analysis:** We need to join `inspections` and `businesses` tables, filter by `score` = 100, and select distinct business names and their inspection years.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100

        * **Sub-question 2.2:** Assign a rank to each year within a business
            * **Analysis:** We'll use the `row_number()` window function to assign a rank to each year within each business, ordered chronologically. This will help us identify consecutive years later.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (<previous sub-query>) AS `T3`

        * **Sub-question 2.3:** Group by business and consecutive year groups and check if the count is 4
            * **Analysis:** We'll group the results by business name and a calculated date representing the start of each potential 4-year period. This date is calculated by adding (`rowNumber` - 1) years to the first day of the year extracted from the `years` column. We then filter for groups with a count of 4, indicating 4 consecutive years.
            * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (<previous sub-query>) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4

**2. Assembling SQL:**

* **Sub-question 2.1 (distinct businesses and years with score 100):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100

* **Sub-question 2.2 (assign rank to each year within a business):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`

* **Sub-question 2.3 (group by business and consecutive year groups):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4

* **Sub-question 2 (4 consecutive years):**
    * **SQL:** `T2`.`name` IN (SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4)

* **Main Question (names of establishments):**
    * **SQL:** SELECT DISTINCT `T2`.`name` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE  `T1`.`score` = 100 AND `T2`.`name` IN (SELECT `T4`.`name` FROM (SELECT `T3`.`name`, `T3`.`years`, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY `T3`.`name` ORDER BY `T3`.`years`) AS `rowNumber` FROM (SELECT DISTINCT `name`, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS `years` FROM `inspections` AS `T1` INNER JOIN `businesses` AS `T2` ON `T1`.`business_id` = `T2`.`business_id` WHERE `T1`.`score` = 100) AS `T3`) AS `T4` GROUP BY `T4`.`name`, date(`T4`.`years` || '-01-01', '-' || (`T4`.`rowNumber` - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(`T4`.`years`) = 4)

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**

* The final SQL query from step 2 can be simplified by merging the nested queries into a single query with a `WITH` clause. This improves readability and potentially performance.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT DISTINCT T4.name FROM ( SELECT T3.name, T3.years, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY T3.name ORDER BY T3.years) AS rowNumber FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT name, STRFTIME('%Y', `date`) AS years FROM inspections AS T1 INNER JOIN businesses AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.score = 100 ) AS T3 ) AS T4 GROUP BY T4.name, date(T4.years || '-01-01', '-' || (T4.rowNumber - 1) || ' years') HAVING COUNT(T4.years) = 4
</FINAL_ANSWER>
